title: "Installing dbt"
---

We recommend you use install dbt using one of four tried-and-tested methods:

- [Homebrew](install/homebrew) (recommended for MacOS)
- [pip](install/pip)
- [Docker image](install/docker)
- [from source](install/from-source)

The standard dbt distribution includes `dbt-core` and the four most popular [adapter plugins](available-adapters): `dbt-postgres`, `dbt-redshift`, `dbt-snowflake`, and `dbt-bigquery`. If you use a different adapter plugin, or if you are unable to install one of the included plugins, you can install a specific plugin [using pip](install/pip#install-a-specific-adapter).
